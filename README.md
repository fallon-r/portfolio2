# portfolio2

For this portfolio, I used [Picnic CSS](https://picnicss.com/) as my CSS framework.

I was drawn to it's simplicity. It came with modals, tooltips, and some other cool features right out of the box. While it was very easy to create a stylish design with very little code, there are some cons. For example, there are a lot less helpers to align HTML elements, and it required more CSS than I would normally use. This is in contrast to Materialize or Bootstrap that make things like this much easier. There is also scant documentation, and not a large community. Despite its shortcomings, I did enjoy using the framework and will likely use it again for future projects. Since its FOSS, I would like to contribute one day!

To create the gifs of my projects in action, I used [Peek](https://github.com/phw/peek). The GUI is super simple and I was able to capture my screen with relative ease.
